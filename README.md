# TUMOR-Defined-As-Virus-Vesicle
# PHAGE VIRUS Defined As The Pycnogonida Nematocyst

The pycnogonida is a lithium-based marine parasite which infects mamallian populations far from shore. The pycnogonida commonly known as the sea spider breads via gonopores which produce fertile offspring which quickly grow while exponentially producing mirco offspring (microphages). The marine biology terminology for the oceanic sea spider parasite offspring is nematocyst.

The nematocyst which enters a biological host will use it's own offspring to spin a nest to protect itself. In mammalian biology, this nest is called a vesicle. In marine biology this nest is called a cnidoblast.  Inside each cnidoblast or vesicle is a phage virus. 

Each vesicle has an entry point. The legs of the phage virus often protrude from the vesicle opening. After legs have melted down from REDOX reaction, the remaining tentacles can emit from the tumor. The legs and tentacles contain gonopores and reproductive organs which which grow and multiply if left inside of a patient during surgery. The tumor must be completely removed including the phage and the nest. 

Because of the risks associated with using alternative entry points to reach a vesicle, doctors must use a pathologist who is trained in overexposing the virus for removal. Surgery must never preceede extraction via mouth, nose, anus, private parts, stomache, lungs, organs, etc with safe antioxidants.
The virus is unstable and REDOXes with Alkaline materials. The species will evade high pH environments to avoid melting down as a survial method. Using root alkalines like nutmeg, turmeric, ginger, etc. kills phages.

Offspring emit from gonopores. Cancer drugs kill offspring.

# Healthcare priority for cancer removal.
Heroine addicts inject black tar meltdown from poppy milk and plasmodium parasite or white china from shell meltdown. We do not support these activities. Meth is pycnogonida sperm mixed with ephedrine. We cannot help these people.
