# Virus-Vesicle-TUMOR
The phage virus which enters a biological host will use it's offspring to spin a nest which it can rapidly eject from. Holes are leg openeings.

The marine parasite terminology is nematocyst. Inside each nematocyst is a phage virus. Each vesicle has an entry point. the legs and tentacles contain phages. The tumor must be completely removed.
