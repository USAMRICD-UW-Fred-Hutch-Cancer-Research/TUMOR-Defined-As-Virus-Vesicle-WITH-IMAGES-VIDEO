# Virus-Vesicle-TUMOR
The phage virus which enters a biological host will use it's offspring to spin a nest which it can rapidly eject from. Holes are leg openeings.

The marine parasite terminology is nematocyst. Inside each nematocyst is a phage virus. Each vesicle has an entry point. the legs and tentacles contain phages. The tumor must be completely removed.

The virus is unstable and REDOXes with Alkaline materials. Using root alkalines like nutmeg, turmeric, ginger, etc. Kills phages.

Heroine addicts inject black tar meltdown from poppy milk and plasmodium parasite or white china from shell meltdown. We do not support these activities. Meth is pycnogonida sperm mixed with ephedrine. We cannot help these people.
